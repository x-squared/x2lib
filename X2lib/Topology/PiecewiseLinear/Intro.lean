# Joins and cones

In this file we introduce `Join` and `Cone` objects as constructs in affine ambient space.
`Cone` will serve as building block for PL-topology.

## Main results

- `exists_foo`: the main existence theorem of `foo`s.

## Notation

 - `|_|` : The barrification operator, see `bar_of_foo`.

## References

See [Rourke] for ann introduction to PL-topology.
